# AUBRUSHLI
I have extended fountain.py so that it can produce CSVs for Cast lists, Breakdown Summaries and Shot lists. AUBRUSHLI is just an acronynm taking the first two letters of Automated Breakdown Shot List and adding a U in the middle. 

Changed it from a CLI app to a GUI app for ease of use. 

Installation is just a case of downloading the zip file from the release for your particular os and unzipping and running https://github.com/StephanosPSteer/AUBRUSHLI/releases/tag/AUBRUSHLI
