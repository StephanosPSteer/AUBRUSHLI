Fade In:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

A woman, JANE (30s), walks along the beach, lost in thought.

JANE
(to herself)
What am I going to do?

She looks out at the ocean and takes a deep breath.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN:

INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jane is sitting on the couch, looking at a photo of herself and her ex-boyfriend, TOM.

JANE
(to herself)
I can't believe he left me.

The doorbell rings. Jane gets up and answers it. It's her best friend, SARAH.

SARAH
Hey, girl. How are you holding up?

JANE
Not great. Tom broke up with me.

SARAH
I'm sorry to hear that. Want to talk about it?

JANE
Yeah, that would be great.

Sarah sits down next to Jane on the couch.

JANE (CONT'D)
I just don't know what to do without him.

SARAH
You'll figure it out. You're strong.

JANE
Thanks, Sarah. You always know what to say.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Jane is sitting at a table, sipping on a coffee. She looks up and sees Tom walking in.

JANE (CONT'D)
(to herself)
Oh no, what do I do now?

Tom walks up to her table.

TOM
Hey, Jane. Can we talk?

JANE
(sighs)
I guess so.

Tom sits down across from her.

TOM (CONT'D)
Look, Jane, I know I hurt you when I broke up with you. But I realized that I made a mistake. I miss you, and I want to try to make things work between us.

Jane looks at him, considering his words.

JANE
I don't know, Tom. I don't think I can trust you again.

TOM
I understand that. But please, just give me a chance to prove myself to you.

Jane takes a deep breath, thinking it over.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jane is sitting at her desk, staring at a blank piece of paper.

JANE (CONT'D)
(to herself)
I can't believe I'm doing this.

She picks up a pen and begins to write.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jane is sitting at her desk, surrounded by crumpled up pieces of paper.

JANE (CONT'D)
(to herself)
This is never going to work.

Suddenly, her phone rings. It's Tom.

JANE (CONT'D)
(on the phone)
Hello?

TOM (V.O.)
Hey, Jane. I was wondering if you wanted to grab some dinner tonight.

JANE
(sighs)
I don't know, Tom. I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.

TOM (V.O.)
I understand. But I really want to make things right between us.

Jane hesitates for a moment, thinking it over.

JANE
Okay, Tom. I'll meet you at 7.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Jane and Tom are sitting at a candlelit table, eating dinner.

TOM
I'm really glad we're doing this, Jane.

JANE
(smiles)
Me too.

There's a moment of silence between them.

TOM
(awkwardly)
So, how's the writing going?

JANE
(laughs)
It's not. I'm a terrible writer.

TOM
I doubt that. You're good at everything you do.

Jane looks at him, considering his words.

JANE
(smiling)
Thanks, Tom. That means a lot.

There's another moment of silence between them.

JANE (CONT'D)
(sighs)
I don't know if I'm ready to forgive you yet.

TOM
I understand that. But please, just give me some time.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jane is sitting at her desk, typing on her laptop. There's a knock at the door.

JANE
(stands up)
I wonder who that could be.

She opens the door and sees Tom standing there, holding a bouquet of flowers.

TOM
Hey, Jane. I know you said you needed some time, but I just wanted to stop by and say I'm sorry.

Jane looks at him, surprised.

JANE
(smiling)
That's really sweet, Tom.

TOM
(looking hopeful)
So, does that mean you forgive me?

JANE
(laughs)
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. But I appreciate the gesture.

TOM
(nodding)
I understand. I just want you to know that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things right between us.

FADE OUT.
